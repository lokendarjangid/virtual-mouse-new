# virtual-mouse-new

**Objective**

The objective of this project is to make an AI mouse which means virtual mouse. In this we donâ€™t need actual mouse for our system we can use our hand for moving cursor on our system. Problem which we face over here that we need actual mouse to control our system or if we are sitting far from our computer than we have to go near computer/laptop to control it but instead of that we can use AI mouse to control system without even an actual mouse or if we sitting far from system there is no need to go near. We just have to run AI mouse program and sit back to control with our hand.
